# CMF 
## Background
The Cluster Mean Field (CMF) approach used in this work was developed by [Jimènez-Hoyos and Scuseria](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05909). 

PySCF-backed helpers (`pyscf_do_scf`, `pyscf_build_ints`, ...) are provided by the
package extension `TPSChemPyCallExt`, which activates when `PyCall` is loaded.
